**How to run the EHR's data harmonization app using an existing variable details sheet**
*item Run the app, choose large pipe-delimited CSV's, Multiple, and .sqlite (as shown in the picture).
*item Add the path to the folder where your original file/files are located.
*item Add a path to a desired .sqlite database (you don't need to create the database, the app does that automatically and you only need to put .sqlite extension at the end of the path.)
